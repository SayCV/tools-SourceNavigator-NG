This file contains a checklist of steps that need to
be taken to create a Source-Navigator release. All
of the source code is located in the CVS repository.
The assumption here is that a CVS tag has already
been created for a particular release, and now the
release file needs to be created.

1. Check the code out of the CVS.

Replace RELEASE_TAG with the tag for this specific
release. It is important to checkout a clean CVS
repo so that extra files that do not exist in the
CVS do not get included in the released file.

% setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourcenav.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sourcenav
% cvs checkout -r RELEASE_TAG snavigator

2. Double check the release number.

The src/snavigator/configure.in script contains an
entry like "AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(sn,5.2a1)". Make sure
the release number is updated correctly since this
number will be used when creating the archive file.

3. Run the release shell script.

% cd src
% sh snavigator/mkdist.sh

The commands above will create a tar/gz file in
the dist dir (defaults is /share/SN51/dist)

4. FTP to upload.sourceforge.net

5. Admin files for release on SourceForge site.

6. Remove the checked out files
