These PowerPC 601 EABI assembly language source files were translated
from the C source code to the GNU gzip utility using the GCC C
compiler and the following command line:

	powerpc-eabi-gcc -S *.c

An additional call to an external C function called "cfunc" has been inserted
into the subroutine called "reset_switches" in gzip.s.  This illustrates
Source-Navigator's cross-language project capabilities.

These files can be parsed using the assembly parser that is shipped
with Source-Navigator.
