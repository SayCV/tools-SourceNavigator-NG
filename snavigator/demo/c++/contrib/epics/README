This directory contains the beginnings of a Glish client for interfacing
between Glish and EPICS.  The EpicsChannel class provides the glue between
an EPICS Channel and a Glish Value.  main.cc provides the beginnings of
the Glish client itself.  The main problem I ran into with this code is
that with the version of EPICS I was using (3.11), there didn't appear to
be any way to extract from the EPICS library which file descriptors it
was using for its input, nor to tell it to add additional file descriptors;
so I wasn't able to add asynchronous channel updates, something you clearly
must have to make full use of EPICS and Glish.
