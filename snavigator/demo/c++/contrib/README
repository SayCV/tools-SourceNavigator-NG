This directory contains subdirectories of Glish clients contributed by
Glish users but not supported (and in some cases not really working, serving
more to inspire than to perform):

	epics/		a Glish <-> EPICS client; only works for synchronous
			channel access

	perl/		a Glish <-> Perl 5.0 client, contributed by Darrell
			Schiebel (drs@nrao.edu).  See perl/sample_client for
			an example, and perl/ext/Glish/README for details and
			copyright.

	tkclient/	a Glish <-> Tcl/TK client; works well, but not
			documented
