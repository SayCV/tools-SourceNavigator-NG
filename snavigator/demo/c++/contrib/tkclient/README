This directory contains "tkclient", a Glish <-> Tcl/TK interface.  The
interface is unsupported and undocumented; on the plus side, it's rather
simple yet effective.  Basically, instantiating a TK_Client object creates
a Tcl/TK interpreter with the following added commands:

	glish_send name value
		sends out an event with the given name and (string) value
	glish_reply value
		replies to a request/reply event with the given value
	glish_exit
		cleanly exits

TK_Client also responds to the following incoming events:

	Tcl	the event's value is interpreted as a string and passed
		to the Tcl interpreter for execution

	TclN	the event's value is interpretered as an array of strings,
		each of which is passed in turn to the Tcl interpreter
