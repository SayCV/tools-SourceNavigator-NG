 * This code has been produced by numerous authors at the CERN centre for *
 * high energy physics, Geneve, Switzerland, at the SSC laboratory in     *
 * Dallas, Texas, USA and at the Lawrence Berekeley Laboratory in         *
 * California, USA.                                                       *
 * The latter two institutions perform work under US Government contract. *
 * The intent of the work is to provide useful code for people who need   *
 * it, with an emphasis on free and collaborative exchange of ideas,      *
 * techniques and implementations.                                        *
