tcltest::test itk-destroy-1 { This test reproduces
        a problem with an itk widget. When an itk
        component contains a sub component that is
        packed into another frame it creates a
        <Destroy> binding that uses the original
        object command. If the object gets deleted
        and then the <Destroy> binding fires, you
        end up with a really tricky bug that
        depends on the order that widgets are
        destroyed } {

    destroy $t
    toplevel $t
    set f [frame $t.f]
    set w [ItkError $t.w -win $f]

    pack $f -side top
    pack $w

    destroy $w
    # This should not raise
    # an error, it does
    # in existing itk code.
    destroy $f
