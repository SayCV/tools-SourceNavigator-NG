<p>The wizard should help to create a new project under alot of advice
from the wizard. It's destination is making this process so easy so that
no customer get confused about this process:
<p>We discussed in sunnyvale how it should looks like. Your comments are
very welcome to improve it.
<p>1. Hello
<p>The first wizard page should contain some words about the wizard and
contain a list of templates
<br>to create a new project. This templates are now not availiable until
we know how they are defined.

<p>2. Project name
<p>The user can specify the project. With this information it's possible
to create a project, so that
<br>a 'finish' button is availaible here.

Page</a>
<p>3. Project settings
<p>User can define here some project related settings. The project settings
now are merged with default options. So splitting preferences needs to
be done parallel to this wizard.

<p>4. File and Directory List to add
<p>Next and last page is to let the user adds the directories and files
into a list that will be part of the project. This works like the import
functionality. The user can add files or directories in one list.
