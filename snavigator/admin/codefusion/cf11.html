Code Fusion 1.1 Specification.</H2>
Some of the main goals of the 1.1 release are to implement features and
bug fixes with minimal engineering and documentation changes.&nbsp; Any
larger changes in the engineering space will be more effective in the in
Code Fusion X release.&nbsp; The Code Fusion X release will be a release
based on the code in devo, this has many enhancements, such as the Itcl3.0
upgrade. (Refer to the <A HREF="file:////Celeste/irox/sndev/devo/snavigator/admin/codefusion/eide.html">Code
Fusion X document</A> for more information.)
<BR>&nbsp;

<H3>
Main requirements:</H3>


<P>1. Change all occurrences of Source-Navigator to Code Fusion.
<BLOCKQUOTE>This has been achieved by adding a new option, --enable-product-name,
to the configure script. If the this option is not specified and --enable-production
is specified then it will set the default product name to Code Fusion.&nbsp;
Another option will have to be added to allow the launch name to be changed,
possibly --enable-exec-name=codefusion.&nbsp; This will allow the user
to launch Code Fusion (the product formally know as Source-Navigator) by
typing 'codefusion' at a command line.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;
<BR>2. Add support for additional and cross compilation tool chains.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Support for cross compilation tool chains and additional tool
chains must be written in the form of a toolchain specification using the
snToolChain class.&nbsp; Once this has been done, support must be added
for configuring Code Fusion to use the required tool chains.&nbsp; When
building Code Fusion, it will include the native tool chain for the build
platform by default and, if --target is specified, it will include the
tool chain specified by --target..&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional configuration
option must be added to allow additional tool chains to be specified; --enable-toolchains=
can be used to specify additional tool chains.&nbsp;&nbsp; All tool chains
specified must exist in Code Fusion.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
Minor enhancements and features changes (with minimal documentation impact):</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The removal of the default 'b' prefix on executable names.
(Minor document change.)

<P>Correct handling of "xterm -e". (Minor, if any documentation change.)

<P>Recursive dependancy generation. (No documentation changes required.)

<P>Adding support for building a shared libraries. (Minor, if any documentation
impact.)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
Additional information required or to be decided:</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Which tool chains are we going to support? (palm pilot, third
party tool chains?)

<P>Measure current documentation impact and assess time/resource to handle
farther changes.
<BR>(How much work can we do if it's only a minor docs impact?)</BLOCKQUOTE>
