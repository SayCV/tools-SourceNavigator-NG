.SH DESCRIPTION
'
.PP
'
The \fBtixTree\fR command creates a new window (given by the
\fIpathName\fR argument) and makes it into a Tree widget.  Additional
options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in
the option database to configure aspects of the Tree widget such as its
cursor and relief.

The Tree widget can be used to display hierachical data in a tree
form. The user can adjust the view of the tree by opening or closing
parts of the tree.

To display a static tree structure, you can add the entries into the
\fBhlist\fR subwidget and hide any entries as desired. Then you can
call the \fBautosetmode\fR method. This will set up the Tree widget so
that it handles all the \fIopen\fR and \fIclose\fR events
automatically. (Please see the demonstration program
demos/samples/Tree.tcl).

The above method is not applicable if you want to maintain a dynamic
tree structure, i.e, you do not know all the entries in the tree and
you need to add or delete entries subsequently. To do this, you should
first create the entries in the \fBhlist\fR subwidget. Then, use the
setmode method to indicate the entries that can be opened or closed,
and use the \fB\-opencmd\fR and \fB \-closecmd\fR options to handle
the opening and closing events. (Please see the demonstration program
demos/samples/DynTree.tcl demo).

.SH WIDGET COMMANDS
.PP
'
The \fBtixTree\fR command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the
same as the path name of the Tree's window.  This command may be used
to invoke various operations on the widget. It has the following
general form:
'
.DS C
'
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.PP
.DE
'
\fIPathName\fR is the name of the command, which is the same as the
Tree widget's path name. \fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behavior of the command. The following commands
are possible for Tree widgets:
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBautosetmode\fR
'
This command calls the \fBsetmode\fR method for all the entries in
this Tree widget: if an entry has no child entries, its mode is set to
\fBnone\fR. Otherwise, if the entry has any hidden child entries, its
mode is set to \fBopen\fR; otherwise its mode is set to \fBclose\fR.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBcget\fR \fIoption\fR
'
Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
\fIoption\fR. \fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the
\fBtixTree\fR command.
'
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBclose \fIentryPath\fR
'
Close the entry given by \fIentryPath\fR if its \fImode\fR is \fBclose\fR.
'
'
.TP
'
\fIpathName \fBconfigure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? \fI?value option value ...\fR?
'
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
\fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for \fIpathName\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list). If \fIoption\fR is specified
with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no \fIoption\fR is specified).  If
one or more \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
this case the command returns an empty string.  \fIOption\fR may have
any of the values accepted by the \fBtixTree\fR command.
'
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBgetmode \fIentryPath\fR
'
Returns the current \fImode\fR of the entry given by \fIentryPath\fR.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBopen \fIentryPath\fR
'
Open the entry givaen by \fIentryPath\fR if its \fImode\fR is \fBopen\fR.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBsetmode \fI entryPath mode\fR
'
This command is used to indicate whether the entry given by
\fIentryPath\fR has children entries and whether the children are
visible. \fImode\fR must be one of \fBopen\fR,
\fBclose\fR or \fBnone\fR. If \fImode\fR is set to \fBopen\fR, a (+)
indicator is drawn next the the entry. If \fImode\fR is set to
\fBclose\fR, a (-) indicator is drawn next the the entry. If
\fImode\fR is set to \fBnone\fR, no indicators will be drawn for this
entry. The default \fImode\fR is none. The \fBopen\fR mode indicates
the entry has hidden children and this entry can be opened by the
user. The \fBclose\fR mode indicates that all the children of the entry
are now visible and the entry can be closed by the user.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBsubwidget \fI name ?args?\fR 
'
When no options are given, this command returns the pathname of the
subwidget of the specified name.

When options are given, the widget command of the specified subwidget
will be called with these options.
'
'
'
'----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH BINDINGS
.PP
'
The basic mouse and keyboard bindings of the Tree widget are the same
as the bindings of the HList widget.

In addition, the entries can be opened or closed under the following
conditions:
'
.IP [1]
If the \fImode\fR of the entry is \fBopen\fR, it can be opened by clicking
on its (+) indicator or double-clicking on the entry.
'
.IP [2]
If the \fImode\fR of the entry is \fBclose\fR, it can be closed by clicking
on its (-) indicator or double-clicking on the entry.
