.SH DESCRIPTION
'
.PP
'
The \fBtixTList\fR command creates a new window (given by the
\fIpathName\fR argument) and makes it into a TList widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the
TList widget such as its cursor and relief.
'
.PP
The TList widget can be used to display data in a tabular format. The
list entries of a TList widget are similar to the entries in the Tk
listbox widget. The main differences are (1) the TList widget can
display the list entries in a two dimensional format and (2) you can
use graphical images as well as multiple colors and fonts for 
the list entries.
'
.PP
Each list entry is identified by an \fBindex\fR, which can be in the
following forms:
.RS
.TP
\fInumber\fR
'
An integer that indicates the position of the entry in the list. 0
means the first position, 1 means the second position, and so on.
'
.TP
\fBend\fR
'
Indicates the end of the listbox. For some commands this means just
after the last entry; for other commands it means the last entry.
'
.TP
\fB@\fR\fIx\fR,\fIy\fR
'
Indicates the element that covers the point in the listbox window
specified by x and y (in pixel coordinates). If no element covers that
point, then the closest element to that point is used.
'
.RE
'
.SH "DISPLAY ITEMS"
.PP
Each list entry in an TList widget is associated with a \fBdisplay
item\fR.  The display item determines what visual information should
be displayed for this list entry. Please see the \fBDItem(n)\fR manual
page for a list of all display items.
'
.PP
When a list entry is created by the \fBinsert\fR command, the type of
its display item is determined by the \fB\-itemtype\fR option passed
to these commands. If the \fB\-itemtype\fR is omitted, then by default
the type specified by this TList widget's \fB\-itemtype\fR option is
used.
'----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH "WIDGET COMMAND"
.PP
'
The \fBtixTList\fR command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the
same as the path name of the TList widget's window.  This command
may be used to invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the
following general form:
'
.DS C
'
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.PP
.DE
'
\fIPathName\fR is the name of the command, which is the same as
the TList widget's path name.  \fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following
commands are possible for TList widgets:
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBanchor set \fIindex\fR
'
Sets the anchor to the list entry identified by \fIindex\fR. The
anchor is the end of the selection that is fixed while dragging out a
selection with the mouse.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBanchor clear\fR
'
Removes the anchor, if any, from this TList widget. This only removes
the surrounding highlights of the anchor entry and does not affect its
selection status.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBcget\fR \fIoption\fR
'
Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
\fIoption\fR. \fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the
\fBtixTList\fR command.
'
.TP
'
\fIpathName \fBconfigure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? \fI?value option value ...\fR?
'
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
\fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for \fIpathName\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list). If \fIoption\fR is specified
with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no \fIoption\fR is specified).  If
one or more \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
this case the command returns an empty string.  \fIOption\fR may have
any of the values accepted by the \fBtixTList\fR command.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBdelete\fR \fIfrom\fR ?\fIto\fR?
Deletes one or more list entries between the two entries specified by
the indices \fIfrom\fR and \fIto\fR. If \fIto\fR is not specified, deletes
the single entry specified by \fIfrom\fR.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBdragsite set \fIindex\fR
'
Sets the dragsite to the list entry identified by
\fIindex\fR. The dragsite is used to indicate the source of a
drag-and-drop action. Currently drag-and-drop functionality has not
been implemented in Tix yet.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBdragsite clear\fR
Remove the dragsite, if any, from the this TList widget. This only
removes the surrounding highlights of the dragsite entry and does not
affect its selection status.
'
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBdropsite set \fIindex\fR
'
Sets the dropsite to the list entry identified by \fIindex\fR. The
dropsite is used to indicate the target of a grag-and-drop
action. Currently drag-and-drop functionality has not been implemented
in Tix yet.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBdropsite clear\fR
'
Remove the dropsite, if any, from the this TList widget. This only
removes the surrounding highlights of the dropsite entry and does not
affect its selection status.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBentrycget\fR \fIindex option\fR
'
Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
\fIoption\fR for the entry indentfied by \fIindex\fR. \fIOption\fR may
have any of the values accepted by the \fBinsert\fR widget command.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBentryconfigure\fI index \fR?\fIoption\fR? \fI?value option value ...\fR?
'
Query or modify the configuration options of the list entry indentfied
by \fIindex\fR. If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list
describing all of the available options for \fIindex\fR (see
\fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for information on the format of this list). If
\fIoption\fR is specified with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command
returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be
identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
\fIoption\fR is specified). If one or more \fIoption\-value\fR pairs
are specified, then the command modifies the given option(s) to have
the given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty string.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBinsert\fR
widget command. The exact set of options depends on the
value of the \fB\-itemtype\fR option passed to the the \fBinsert\fR
widget command when this list entry is created.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBinsert\fI index \fR?\fIoption value ...\fR?
'
Creates a new list entry at the position indicated by \fIindex\fR. The
following configuration options can be given to configure the list
entry:
'
.RS
'
.TP
\fB\-itemtype\fI type\fR
'
Specifies the type of display item to be display for the new list
entry. \fItype\fR must be a valid display item type. Currently the
available display item types are \fBimage\fR, \fBimagetext\fR,
\fBtext\fR, and \fBwindow\fR. If this option is not specified, then by
default the type specified by this TList widget's \fB\-itemtype\fR
option is used.
'
.TP
\fB\-state\fR
'
Specifies whether this entry can be selected or invoked by the user.
Must be either \fBnormal\fR or \fBdisabled\fR.
'
.RE
'
The \fBinsert\fR widget command accepts additional configuration options
to configure the display item associated with this list entry. The set
of additional configuration options depends on the type of the display
item given by the \fB\-itemtype\fR option. Please see the
\fBDItem(n)\fR manual page for a list of the configuration options for
each of the display item types.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBinfo \fIoption\fR \fIarg ...\fR
'
Query information about the TList widget. \fIoption\fR can be one
of the following:
.RS
.TP
\fIpathName \fBinfo \fBanchor\fR \fIindex\fR
;
Returns the index of the current anchor, if any, of the TList
widget. If the anchor is not set, returns the empty string.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBinfo \fBdragsite\fR \fIindex\fR
Returns the index of the current dragsite, if any, of the TList
widget. If the dragsite is not set, returns the empty string.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBinfo \fBdropsite\fR \fIindex\fR
Returns the index of the current dropsite, if any, of the TList
widget. If the dropsite is not set, returns the empty string.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBinfo \fBselection\fR
'
Returns a list of selected elements in the TList widget. If no entries
are selectd, returns an empty string.
.RE
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBnearest \fIx y\fR
'
Given an (x,y) coordinate within the TList window, this command
returns the index of the TList element nearest to that coordinate.
'
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBsee \fIindex\fR
'
Adjust the view in the TList so that the entry given by \fIindex\fR is
visible. If the entry is already visible then the command has no
effect; if the entry is near one edge of the window then the TList
scrolls to bring the element into view at the edge; otherwise the
TList widget scrolls to center the entry.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBselection \fIoption\fR \fIarg ...\fR
'
This command is used to adjust the selection within a TList widget. It
has several forms, depending on \fIoption\fR:
.RS
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBselection clear \fR?\fIfrom\fR? ?\fIto\fR?
'
When no extra arguments are given, deselects all of the list entrie(s)
in this TList widget. When only \fIfrom\fR is given, only the list
entry identified by \fIfrom\fR is deselected. When both \fIfrom\fR and
\fIto\fR are given, deselects all of the list entrie(s) between
between \fIfrom\fR and \fIto\fR, inclusive, without affecting the
selection state of entries outside that range.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBselection includes \fIindex\fR
'
Returns 1 if the list entry indicated by \fIindex\fR is currently
selected; returns 0 otherwise.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBselection set \fIfrom\fR ?\fIto\fR?
'
Selects all of the list entrie(s) between between \fIfrom\fR and
\fIto\fR, inclusive, without affecting the selection state of entries
outside that range. When only \fIfrom\fR is given, only the list entry
identified by \fIfrom\fR is selected.
.RE
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBxview \fIargs\fR
This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of the
information in the widget's window. It can take any of the following
forms:
.RS
.TP
\fIpathName \fBxview\fR
'
Returns a list containing two elements.  Each element is a real
fraction between 0 and 1; together they describe the horizontal span
that is visible in the window.  For example, if the first element is
.2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the TList entry is
off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and
40% of the entry is off-screen to the right. These are the same values
passed to scrollbars via the \fB\-xscrollcommand\fR option.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBxview\fR \fIindex\fR
'
Adjusts the view in the window so that the list entry identified by
\fIindex\fR is aligned to the left edge of the window.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBxview moveto\fI fraction\fR
'
Adjusts the view in the window so that \fIfraction\fR of the total
width of the TList is off-screen to the left. \fIfraction\fR must be
a fraction between 0 and 1.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fBxview scroll \fInumber what\fR
'
This command shifts the view in the window left or right according to
\fInumber\fR and \fIwhat\fR. \fINumber\fR must be an integer.
\fIWhat\fR must be either \fBunits\fR or \fBpages\fR or an
abbreviation of one of these. If \fIwhat\fR is \fBunits\fR, the view
adjusts left or right by \fInumber\fR character units (the width of
the \fB0\fR character) on the display; if it is \fBpages\fR then the
view adjusts by \fInumber\fR screenfuls. If \fInumber\fR is negative
then characters farther to the left become visible; if it is positive
then characters farther to the right become visible.
'
.RE
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fByview \fI?args\fR?
'
This command is used to query and change the vertical position of the
entries in the widget's window. It can take any of the following forms:
'
.RS
.TP
\fIpathName \fByview\fR
'
Returns a list containing two elements, both of which are real
fractions between 0 and 1.  The first element gives the position of
the list element at the top of the window, relative to the TList as a
whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the TList, for example).  The
second element gives the position of the list entry just after the
last one in the window, relative to the TList as a whole.  These are
the same values passed to scrollbars via the \fB\-yscrollcommand\fR
option.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fByview\fR \fIindex\fR
'
Adjusts the view in the window so that the list entry given by
\fIindex\fR is displayed at the top of the window.
'
.TP
\fIpathName \fByview moveto\fI fraction\fR
'
Adjusts the view in the window so that the list entry given by
\fIfraction\fR appears at the top of the window. \fIFraction\fR is a
fraction between 0 and 1; 0 indicates the first entry in the TList,
0.33 indicates the entry one-third the way through the TList, and so
on.
.TP
\fIpathName \fByview scroll \fInumber what\fR
'
This command adjust the view in the window up or down according to
\fInumber\fR and \fIwhat\fR.  \fINumber\fR must be an integer.
\fIWhat\fR must be either \fBunits\fR or \fBpages\fR.  If \fIwhat\fR
is \fBunits\fR, the view adjusts up or down by \fInumber\fR lines; if
it is \fBpages\fR then the view adjusts by \fInumber\fR screenfuls.
If \fInumber\fR is negative then earlier entries become visible; if
it is positive then later entries become visible.
