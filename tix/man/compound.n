.SH NAME
Compound \- Create multi-line compound images.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBimage create compound \fR?\fIname\fR? ?\fIoptions\fR?
.BE
'
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
'
Compound image types can be used to create images that consists of
multiple horizontal lines; each line is composed of a series of items
(texts, bitmaps, images or spaces) arranged from left to
right. Compound images are mainly used to embed complex drawings into
widgets that support the \fB\-image\fR option. As shown in the EXAMPLE
section below, a compound image can be used to display a bitmap and a
text string simutaneously in a TK \fBbutton(n)\fR widget.
'
.SH "CREATING COMPOUND IMAGES"
.PP
Like all images, compound images are created using the \fBimage create\fR
command. Compound images support the following \fIoptions\fR:
.TP
\fB\-background \fIcolor\fR
'
Specifies the background color of the compound image. This color is
also used as the default background color for the bitmap items in the
compound image.
'
.TP
\fB\-borderwidth \fIpixels\fR
'
Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the 3-D border
drawn around the compound image.
'
.TP
\fB\-font \fIfont\fR
'
Specifies the default font for the text items in the compound image.
'
.TP
\fB\-foreground \fIcolor\fR
'
Specifies the default foreground color for the bitmap and text items
in the compound image.
'
.TP
\fB\-padx \fIvalue\fR
'
Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to
request for the compound image in the X-direction. The \fIvalue\fR may
have any of the forms acceptable to \fBTk_GetPixels(3)\fR.
'
.TP
\fB\-pady \fIvalue\fR
'
Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to
request for the compound image in the Y-direction.
.TP
\fB\-relief \fIvalue\fR
'
Specifies the 3-D effect desired for the background of the compound
image. Acceptable values are \fBraised\fR, \fBsunken\fR, \fBflat\fR,
\fBridge\fR, and \fBgroove\fR.
'
.TP
\fB\-showbackground \fIvalue\fR
'
Specifies whether the background and the 3D borders should be drawn.
Must be a valid boolean value. By default the background is not drawn
and the compound image appears to have a transparent background.
'
.TP
\fB\-window \fIpathName\fR
'
Specifies the window in which the compound image is displayed. One
compound image can be displayed in only one window. When that window
is destroyed, the compound image is automatically destroyed as well.
This option must be specified when calling the \fBimage create
compound\fR command and cannot be changed by the \fBconfigure\fR image
command.
'
.SH "IMAGE COMMAND"
.PP
When a compound image is created, Tk also creates a new command whose
name is the same as the image. This command may be used to invoke
various operations on the image. It has the following general form:
.DS C
\fIimageName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.DE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
'
determine the exact behavior of the command. The following
commands are possible for compound images:
'
'
.TP
\fIimageName \fBadd line\fR ?\fIoption value ...\fR?
'
Creates a new line at the bottom of the compound image. Lines support
the following \fIoptions\fR:
.RS
.TP
\fB\-anchor\fR value
'
Specifies how the line should be aligned along the horizontal axis.
When the values are \fBw\fR, \fBsw\fR or \fBnw\fR, the line is aligned
to the left. When the values are \fBc\fR, \fBs\fR or \fBn\fR, the line
is aligned to the middle.  When the values are \fBe\fR, \fBse\fR or
\fBne\fR, the line is aligned to the right.
'
.TP
\fB\-padx \fIvalue\fR
'
Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to
request for this line in the X-direction.
.RE
'
.TP
\fIimageName \fBadd \fIitem-type\fR ?\fIoption value ...\fR?
'
Creates a new item of the type \fIitem-type\fR at the end of the last
line of the compound image. All types of items support
these following common \fIoptions\fR:
.RS
.TP
\fB-anchor\fR value
'
Specifies how the item should be aligned along the vertical axis. When
the values are \fBn\fR, \fBnw\fR or \fBne\fR, the item is aligned to
the top of the line. When the values are \fBc\fR, \fBw\fR or \fBe\fR,
the item is aligned to the middle of the line.  When the values are
\fBs\fR, \fBse\fR or \fBsw\fR, the item is aligned to the bottom of
the line.
'
.TP
\fB\-padx \fIvalue\fR
'
Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to
request for this item in the X-direction.
'
.TP
\fB\-pady \fIvalue\fR
'
Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to
request for this item in the Y-direction.
'
.TP
\fIitem-type\fR can be any of the following:
.RE

Creates a new bitmap item of at the end of the last
line of the compound image. Additional \fIoptions\fR accepted by the
bitmap type are:
'
.RS
.TP
\fB\-background \fIcolor\fR
'
Specifies the background color of the bitmap item.
'
'
.TP
\fB\-bitmap \fIname\fR
'
Specifies a bitmap to display in this item, in any of the forms
acceptable to \fBTk_GetBitmap(3)\fR.
'

.RE
'----------------------------------------
.TP
\fIimageName \fBadd space\fR ?\fIoption value ...\fR?
'
Creates a new space item of at the end of the last line of the
compound image. Space items do not display anything. They just acts as
space holders that add additional spaces between items inside a
compound image. Additional \fIoptions\fR accepted by the image type
are:
'
.RS
.TP
'
.TP
\fB\-width \fIvalue\fR

the forms acceptable to \fBTk_GetPixels(3)\fR.
'
.RE
'----------------------------------------
.TP
\fIimageName \fBadd text\fR ?\fIoption value ...\fR?
'
Creates a new text item of at the end of the last line of the compound
image. Additional \fIoptions\fR accepted by the text type are:

Specifies the foreground color of the text item.
'
.TP
\fB\-justify\fR \fIvalue\fR
'
When there are multiple lines of text displayed in a text item, this
option determines how the lines line up with each other. \fIvalue\fR
must be one of \fBleft\fR, \fBcenter\fR, or \fBright\fR.  \fBLeft\fR
means that the lines' left edges all line up, \fBcenter\fR means that
the lines' centers are aligned, and \fBright\fR means that the lines'
right edges line up.
'
.TP
\fB\-text \fIstring\fR
'
Specifies a text string to display in this text item.
'
.TP
\fB\-underline\fR \fIvalue\fR
'
Specifies the integer index of a character to underline in the text
item. 0 corresponds to the first character of the text displayed in
the text item, 1 to the next character, and so on.
'
.TP
\fB\-wraplength\fR \fIvalue\fR
'
This option specifies the maximum line length of the label string on
this text item. If the line length of the label string exceeds this
length, it is wrapped onto the next line, so that no line is longer
than the specified length. The value may be specified in any of the
standard forms for screen distances. If this value is less than or
equal to 0 then no wrapping is done: lines will break only at newline
characters in the text.
'
.RE
'----------------------------------------
'
.TP
\fIimageName \fBcget\fR \fIoption\fR
'
Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
\fIoption\fR. \fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the
\fBimage create compound\fR command.
'
.TP
\fIimageName \fBconfigure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? ?\fIvalue option value ...\fR? 
'
Query or modify the configuration options for the image. If no
\fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list describing all of the
available options for \fIimageName\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list).  If \fIoption\fR is specified
with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no \fIoption\fR is specified).  If
one or more \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case
the command returns an empty string. \fIOption\fR may have any of the
values accepted by the \fBimage create compound\fR command, except the
\fB\-window\fR option
'.
