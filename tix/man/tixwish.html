</pre><H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
<P>
<B>Tixwish</B></I> is a simple program consisting of the Tcl command
language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that reads commands from
standard input or from a file.  It creates a main window and then
processes Tcl commands.
If <B>tixwish</B></I> is invoked with no arguments, or with a first
interactively from standard input.
It will continue processing commands until all windows have been
deleted or until end-of-file is reached on standard input.  If there
exists a file <B>.tixwishrc</B></I> in the home directory of the user,
<B>tixwish</B></I> evaluates the file as a Tcl script just before reading
the first command from standard input.
<P>
If <B>tixwish</B></I> is invoked with an initial <I>fileName</I></B> argument,
then <I>fileName</I></B> is treated as the name of a script file.
<B>Tixwish</B></I> will evaluate the script in <I>fileName</I></B> (which
presumably creates a user interface), then it will respond to events
until all windows have been deleted.  Commands will not be read from
standard input.  There is no automatic evaluation of <B>.tixwishrc</B></I>
in this case, but the script file can always <B>source</B></I> it if
desired.

</pre><H3>OPTIONS</H3>
<P>
<B>Tixwish</B></I> automatically processes all of the command-line options
described in the <B>OPTIONS</B></I> summary above.  Any other command-line
arguments besides these are passed through to the application using
the <B>argc</B></I> and <B>argv</B></I> variables described later.

</pre><H3>APPLICATION NAME AND CLASS</H3>
<P>
The name of the application, which is used for purposes such as
<B>send</B></I> commands, is taken from the <B>-name</B></I> option,
if it is specified;  otherwise it is taken from <I>fileName</I></B>,
if it is specified, or from the command name by which
character, then only the characters after the last slash are used
as the application name.
<P>
The class of the application, which is used for purposes such as
specifying options with a <B>RESOURCE_MANAGER</B></I> property or .Xdefaults
file, is the same as its name except that the first letter is
capitalized.

</pre><H3>VARIABLES</H3>
<P>
<B>Tixwish</B></I> sets the following Tcl variables:
<DL>
<DT> <B>argc</B></I>
</I></B>
<DD> Contains a count of the number of <I>arg</I></B> arguments (0 if none),
not including the options described above.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>argv</B></I>
</I></B>
<DD> Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the <I>arg</I></B> arguments (not
including the options described above), in order, or an empty string
if there are no <I>arg</I></B> arguments.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>argv0</B></I>
</I></B>
<DD> Contains <I>fileName</I></B> if it was specified.
Otherwise, contains the name by which <B>tixwish</B></I> was invoked.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>geometry</B></I>
</I></B>
<DD> If the <B>-geometry</B></I> option is specified, <B>tixwish</B></I> copies its
value into this variable.  If the variable still exists after
<I>fileName</I></B> has been evaluated, <B>tixwish</B></I> uses the value of
the variable in a <B>wm geometry</B></I> command to set the main
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>tcl_interactive</B></I>
</I></B>
<DD> Contains 1 if <B>tixwish</B></I> is reading commands interactively
(<B>fileName</B></I> was not specified and standard input is a
terminal-like device), 0 otherwise.
</DL>
</pre><H3>X RESOURCES</H3>
<B>Tixwish</B></I> makes use of several X Resources to determine the
<B>Toolkit Options</B></I> for the Tix library. These X resources must be
set using <B>RESOURCE_MANAGER</B></I> properties or .Xdefaults files
<B>before</B></I> <B>tixwish</B></I> starts running. These resources must be
associated with the main window of the <B>tixwish</B></I> application.
These options include:
<P>
<pre><code><code><code>
Name:		<B>tixScheme</B></I>
Class:		<B>TixScheme</B></I>
</code></code></code></pre>
<UL>
Specifies the color scheme to use for the Tix application. Currently
only these schemes are supported: Blue, Gray, SGIGray, TixGray, and
TK.
</UL>
<P>
<pre><code><code><code>
Name:		<B>tixFontSet</B></I>
Class:		<B>TixFontSet</B></I>
</code></code></code></pre>
<UL>
Specifies the FontSet to use for the Tix application. A FontSet
designates the fonts to use for different types of widgets. Currently
only these FontSets are supported: 12Point, 14Point and TK.
</UL>
<P>
For example, you may put these two lines in your .Xdefaults file
<pre><code><code><code>
    *tixwish.tixScheme: Gray
    *tixwish.tixFontSet: 12Point
</code></code></code></pre>
</pre><H3>SCRIPT FILES</H3>
<P>
If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is
<pre>
<B>#!/usr/local/bin/tixwish</B></I>
</pre>
then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if you
mark it as executable.  This assumes that <B>tixwish</B></I> has been
Many UNIX systems do not allow the <B>#!</B></I> line to exceed about 30
characters in length, so be sure that the <B>tixwish</B></I> executable can be
accessed with a short file name.

</pre><H3>PROMPTS</H3>
<P>
When <B>tixwish</B></I> is invoked interactively it normally prompts for each
variables <B>tcl_prompt1</B></I> and <B>tcl_prompt2</B></I>.  If variable
<B>tcl_prompt1</B></I> exists then it must consist of a Tcl script to
output a prompt; instead of outputting a prompt <B>tixwish</B></I> will
evaluate the script in <B>tcl_prompt1</B></I>.  The variable
<B>tcl_prompt2</B></I> is used in a similar way when a newline is typed but
then no prompt is output for incomplete commands.
