# tkScreenChanged --
# This procedure is invoked by the binding mechanism whenever the
# "current" screen is changing.  The procedure does two things.
# First, it uses "upvar" to make global variable "tkPriv" point at an
# array variable that holds state for the current display.  Second,
# it initializes the array if it didn't already exist.
#
# Arguments:
# screen -		The name of the new screen.
