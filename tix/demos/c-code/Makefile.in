# This file is a Makefile for Tk.  If it has the name "Makefile.in"
# then it is a template for a Makefile;  to generate the actual Makefile,
# run "./configure", which is a configuration script generated by the
# "autoconf" program (constructs like "@foo@" will get replaced in the
# actual Makefile.

# To enable memory debugging reverse the comment characters on the following
