                            TIX INSTALLATION GUIDE

   This version of Tix supports both Unix and Windows platforms. We
   provide binary distribution for Windows and popular Unix platforms
   (SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.x and Linux) for hassle-free installation.

   If you use other platforms, you have to download the Tix source and
   build it yourself. The following documents guide you through the
   process of building Tix step by step. There are automatic
   configuration tools to aid you in building Tix. If you have built
   Tcl/Tk or Tcl extensions before, building Tix should be straight
   forward.

     * Installing Tix from the binary distribution.
     * Building Tix for Unix platforms.
     * Building Tix for Windows platforms.
