INTRODUCTION

  Traditionally, Tcl/Tk and its extensions require an extensive set of
  run-time scripts. These scripts are usually stored as
  /usr/local/lib/<package>/*.tcl. When a Tcl/Tk executable starts up,
  it looks for the scripts in the /usr/local directory, or as defined
  by enviornment variables such as TCL_LIBRARY or TIX_LIBRARY.

  The need of an external script library sometimes causes problems
  because users may need to keep track of their TCL_LIBRARY environment
  variables. Also, it is quite difficult to distribute a Tcl
  executable to a customer's site if the customer's machines don't
  already have Tcl installed.

  One solution of this problem is to compile stand-alone versions
  Tcl/Tk application. The scripts can be compiled into into the
  application executable, or into shared libraries which are linked
  into the executable. The distrution of a monolithic executable, or
  one executable with several shared libraries, is substantially
  easier than the distribution of many Tcl scripts scattered around in
  differenr directories.

COMPILING STAND-ALONE TIX

  Currently Tix supports standalone modules only for Tcl version 7.5
  and 7.6 on Unix. Read the file docs/UnixInst.html first before
  reading the rest of this section.

  To exable Tix stand-alone module, change into a Unix build directory
  and run the configure script with the --enable-sam option. Then, run
  "make". When "make" finishes, you will get several libraries and
  executables (the names may vary depending on the version of Tcl and
  the Unix platform):

	libtix4.1.7.6.so	Standard Tix shared library.
	tixwish			Standard Tix shell.

	libtixsam4.1.7.6.so	Tix SAM library.
	libtksam4.2.so		Tk Sam library.
	libtclsam7.6.so		Tcl Sam library.
	satixwish		Stand-alone Tix shell
	sawish			Stand-alone Tk shell
	satclsh			Stand-alone Tcl shell	


DISTRIBUTING satixwish

   satixwish is linked to the following libraries
	libtixsam		Tix c code and scripts
	libtksam		Tk scripts.
	libtk			Tk c code
	libtclsam		Tcl scripts
	libtcl			Tcl c code.

   If you would like to distribute satixwish, you should include the
   satixwish executable, the five shared libraries and your
   application's Tcl scripts. There is no need to include the Tcl, Tk
   and Tix script libraries.

DYNAMICALLY LOADING TIX SAM

   You can also dynamically load libtixsam into a running wish. If you
   have properly installed Tix, you can execute the command

	package require -exact Tixsam [tixBinVer 4.1]

   If Tix has not been installed in your system, you can still use the
   "load" command to dynamically load Tixsam:

	load [file join $dir \
	    libtixsam[tixBinVer 4.1][info sharedlibextension]] \
	    Tixsam

   See the file docs/Pkg.txt for discussions on the tixBinVer
   procedure and dynamic loading of Tix.

USING TIX WITH EMBEDDED TK

  Embedded Tk (ET) is another popular package for creating stand-alone
  Tcl/Tk applications. Older versions of Tix used to support
  ET. However, the scripts of this version of Tix cannot be compiled
  by the et2c program. If you want to use Tix in an ET-enabled
  application, you should link libtixsam with your application and
  call Tixsam_Init() to initialize the stand-alone Tix module. See the
  directory demos/et for an example.
