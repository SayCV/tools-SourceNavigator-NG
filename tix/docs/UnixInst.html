  There are several versions of Tcl/Tk being used today. The newer
  <b>Tcl 7.5, 7.6 and 8.0</b> releases are becoming popular
  because they can run on Windows, Unix and Macintosh. However, many
  people are still using <b>Tcl 7.4</b>. Another popular variant of
  Tcl is <a href="http"//www.tcltk.com/"> <b>Itcl</b> </a>, which adds
  object-oriented functionality to the Tcl language. Version <b>Itcl
  2.0, 2.1 and 2.2</b> are being widely used now. <p>

  Tix supports all of these versions of Tcl and Itcl so you can freely
  choose a version of Tcl or Itcl that works best for you. The
  following steps guide you through the process of building the Tix
  binary for your choice of the version(s) of Tcl or Itcl on Unix
  platforms.

<h3> 1. Download the Tcl, Tk and/or Itcl sources </h3>

  You may have already installed Tcl, Tk and Itcl on your system. The
  installed binaries usually reside in the <b>/usr/local/</b>
  directory. However, the build process of Tix doesn't use the
  installed binaries because doing that may result in subtle version
  conflects. Instead, Tix uses only the binaries from the Tcl, Tk and
  Itcl source directories. Install sources of these packages if they
  are not already in your system. <p>

  <ul>

    <li> <b>Tcl 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 and 8.0</b>: The source code of these
    Tcl releases can be found at <a href="ftp://ftp.sunlabs.com/pub">
    ftp://ftp.sunlabs.com/pub </a>. Remember to download the source
    code of the corresponding versions of Tk as well. <p>


    <li> <b>Itcl 2.0</b>: The source code can be found at <a
    href="ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/tcl/alcatel/extensions/itcl2.0.tar.gz">
    ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/tcl/alcatel/extensions/itcl2.0.tar.gz
    </a>. <p>

    <li> <b>Itcl 2.1 and 2.2</b>: Download the source code from <a
    href="ftp://www.tcltk.com/pub/itcl">ftp://www.tcltk.com/pub/itcl</a><p>

  </ul>

  Make sure that the source directory of these package reside in the
  same directory as Tix. For example, to compile Tix 4.1.0 for Tcl 7.6
  and Itcl 2.1, a typical source directory would look like this:<p>
 
  <blockquote><pre><b>
  /home/src/tcl7.6/
  /home/src/tk4.2/
  /home/src/itcl2.1/
  /home/src/Tix4.1.0/
  </b></pre></blockquote>

  <b> IMPORTANT: </b> <i>Do not arrange your source directory in any
  other way. Do not change the names for these directories. Otherwise
  Tix will not be configured properly.</i><p>

<h3> 2. Configure and compile the desired version(s) of Tcl and/or Itcl</h3>

  Tcl, Tk and Itcl comes with installation guides and should be easy
  to build. In case you have any problems building these packages, you
  can send your questions to the comp.lang.tcl newsgroup or to the
  respective authors of these packages. You may also send mail to
  <a href="mailto:tix-support@xpi.com">tix-support@xpi.com</a>. <p>

  For example, assuming your source directory is structured as above,
  you can build Tcl 7.6 and Tk 4.2 by issuing the following Unix commands:

  <blockquote><pre><b>
  cd /home/src/tcl7.6/unix
  ./configure --enable-shared
  make
  cd /home/src/tk4.2/unix
  ./configure --enable-shared
  make
  </b></pre></blockquote>
  <p>
  
<h3> 3. Configure and compile Tix </h3>

  <ol>

    <li> Make sure you have configured and build the desired
    version(s) of Tcl and/or Itcl. <p>


    <li> Change into the <code><b>Tix4.1.0/unix</b></code>
    directory and execute the configure script:
	 
  <blockquote><pre><b>
  cd /home/src/Tix4.1.0/unix
  ./configure
  </b></pre></blockquote>

    <li> Inside the <code><b>Tix4.1.0/unix</b></code> directory, you
    will see several subdirectories for building Tix for specific
    version of Tcl/Tk or Itcl. Change into the appropriate
    subdirectory. For example, if you want to build Tix for
    Tcl7.6/Tk4.2, execute the following commands:

	 
  <blockquote><pre><b>
  cd tk4.2
  ./configure --enable-shared
  make
  </b></pre></blockquote>

	 Before you run the <code><b>configure</b></code> script, you can type:

  <blockquote><pre><b>
  ./configure --help
  </b></pre></blockquote>
	 
	 to find out the available options.

    <li> Repeat step 3 for any other versions of Tcl/Tk or
    Itcl that you want to build Tix for. <p>

  </ol>
	 
<h3> 4. Experimenting with Tix</h3>

  When you finish building Tix, you will find the
  <code><b>tixwish</b></code> program inside the build directories
  (e.g., <code><b>Tix4.1.0/unix/tk4.2/tixwish</b></code>). Or, if you
  build Tix for Itcl, the program will be called
  <code><b>itixwish</b></code>. <p>

  Tix comes with a number of demo programs. You can run these
  program by running the <b>demos/widget</b> script with
  <b>tixwish</b> or <b>itixwish</b>. Make sure that you have set the
  <b>TIX_LIBRARY</b> variable accordingly (see below). If you haven't
  installed Tcl and/or Tk then you'll need to set your
  <b>TCL_LIBRARY</b> and <b>TK_LIBRARY</b> environment variable as
  well (see the Tcl and Tk README files for information on this). <p>

  You can type the following command in your shell:<p>

  <blockquote><pre><b>
  cd /home/src/Tix4.1.0/demos
  env TIX_LIBRARY=/home/src/Tix4.1.0/library ../unix/tk4.2/tixwish widget
  </b></pre></blockquote> 

  This will open up the Tix demo window. You can click on the "<b>Run
  Sample Programs</b>" tab and execute the sample programs: <p>

  <center><IMG SRC="img/demo1.gif"> <p> <b>(Screen 4.1 Tix widget
  demostration program)</b></center> <p>

<h3> 5. Installing Tix</h3>

  If you are sufficiently convinced that Tix works properly, you can
  install the Tix binaries and scripts on your system. If you are
  paranoid, these is a small set of test scripts that tests the
  behavior of Tix under various configurations. You can do this by
  typing "<b>make tests</b>" inside the build-subdirectories, e.g.:

  <blockquote><pre><b>
  cd /home/src/Tix4.1.0/unix/tk4.2
  make tests
  </b></pre></blockquote> 

  Hopefully it will report "<b>0 error(s) found</b>". <p>

  Type "<b>make install</b>" to install Tix's binaries and script
  files in standard places: <p>

  <blockquote><pre><b>
  cd /home/src/Tix4.1.0/unix
  make install
  </b></pre></blockquote> 

  In the default configuration information will be installed in
  <b>/usr/local</b> so you'll need write permission on this
  directory. If you'd like to use a different installation directory,
  you can specify the "<b>--exec-prefix</b>" and "<b>--prefix</b>"
  options for the configure script in step <b>3</b> and then rebuild
  Tix.<p>


<h3> 6. Trouble Shooting</h3>

  If <b>make</b> fails then you'll have to personalize the
  <b>Makefile</b>'s for your site or possibly modify the distribution
  in other ways.  First check the files <a href="FAQ.html">
  docs/FAQ.html </a> and <a href="Porting.html">docs/Porting.html</a>
  to see if there are hints for compiling on your system. If you need
  to modify <b>Makefile</b>'s, there are comments at the beginning of
  it that describe the things you might want to change and how to
  change them.<p>

  If you have trouble compiling Tix, I'd suggest looking at the files
  <a href="FAQ.html">docs/FAQ.html</a> and <a
  href="Porting.html">docs/Porting.html</a>. It contains information
  that people have sent me about changes they had to make to compile
  Tix in various environments.<p>

  I make no guarantees that this information is accurate, complete, or
  up-to-date, but you may find it useful. If you get Tix running on a
  new configuration and had to make non-trivial changes to do it, I'd
  be happy to receive new information to add to <a
  href="Porting.html">docs/Porting.html</a>. I'm also interested in
  hearing how to change the configuration setup so that Tix compiles
  on additional platforms "out of the box". <p>
