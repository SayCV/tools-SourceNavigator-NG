                          BUILDING THE UNIX BINARIES

   There are several versions of Tcl/Tk being used today. The newer Tcl
   7.5, 7.6 and 8.0 releases are becoming popular because they can run
   on Windows, Unix and Macintosh. However, many people are still using
   Tcl 7.4. Another popular variant of Tcl is Itcl , which adds
   object-oriented functionality to the Tcl language. Version Itcl 2.0,
   2.1 and 2.2 are being widely used now.

   Tix supports all of these versions of Tcl and Itcl so you can freely
   choose a version of Tcl or Itcl that works best for you. The following
   steps guide you through the process of building the Tix binary for
   your choice of the version(s) of Tcl or Itcl on Unix platforms.

  1. DOWNLOAD THE TCL, TK AND/OR ITCL SOURCES

   You may have already installed Tcl, Tk and Itcl on your system. The
   installed binaries usually reside in the /usr/local/ directory.
   However, the build process of Tix doesn't use the installed binaries
   because doing that may result in subtle version conflects. Instead,
   Tix uses only the binaries from the Tcl, Tk and Itcl source
   directories. Install sources of these packages if they are not already
   in your system.

     * Tcl 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 and 8.0: The source code of these Tcl releases
       can be found at ftp://ftp.sunlabs.com/pub . Remember to download
       the source code of the corresponding versions of Tk as well.

     * Itcl 2.0: The source code can be found at
       ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/tcl/alcatel/extensions/itcl2.0.tar.gz
       .

     * Itcl 2.1 and 2.2: Download the source code from
       ftp://www.tcltk.com/pub/itcl

   Make sure that the source directory of these package reside in the
   same directory as Tix. For example, to compile Tix 4.1.0 for Tcl 7.6
   and Itcl 2.1, a typical source directory would look like this:

  /home/src/tcl7.6/
  /home/src/tk4.2/
  /home/src/itcl2.1/
  /home/src/Tix4.1.0/

   IMPORTANT: Do not arrange your source directory in any other way. Do
   not change the names for these directories. Otherwise Tix will not be
   configured properly.

  2. CONFIGURE AND COMPILE THE DESIRED VERSION(S) OF TCL AND/OR ITCL

   Tcl, Tk and Itcl comes with installation guides and should be easy to
   build. In case you have any problems building these packages, you can
   send your questions to the comp.lang.tcl newsgroup or to the
   respective authors of these packages. You may also send mail to
   tix-support@xpi.com.

   For example, assuming your source directory is structured as above,
   you can build Tcl 7.6 and Tk 4.2 by issuing the following Unix
   commands:

  cd /home/src/tcl7.6/unix
  ./configure --enable-shared
  make
  cd /home/src/tk4.2/unix
  ./configure --enable-shared
  make

  3. CONFIGURE AND COMPILE TIX
    1. Make sure you have configured and build the desired version(s) of
       Tcl and/or Itcl.

    2. Change into the Tix4.1.0/unix directory and execute the configure
       script:

  cd /home/src/Tix4.1.0/unix
  ./configure

    3. Inside the Tix4.1.0/unix directory, you will see several
       subdirectories for building Tix for specific version of Tcl/Tk or
       Itcl. Change into the appropriate subdirectory. For example, if
       you want to build Tix for Tcl7.6/Tk4.2, execute the following
       commands:

  cd tk4.2
  ./configure --enable-shared
  make

   Before you run the configure script, you can type:

  ./configure --help

   to find out the available options.
    4. Repeat step 3 for any other versions of Tcl/Tk or Itcl that you
       want to build Tix for.

  4. EXPERIMENTING WITH TIX

   When you finish building Tix, you will find the tixwish program inside
   the build directories (e.g., Tix4.1.0/unix/tk4.2/tixwish). Or, if you
   build Tix for Itcl, the program will be called itixwish.

   Tix comes with a number of demo programs. You can run these program by
   running the demos/widget script with tixwish or itixwish. Make sure
   that you have set the TIX_LIBRARY variable accordingly (see below). If
   you haven't installed Tcl and/or Tk then you'll need to set your
   TCL_LIBRARY and TK_LIBRARY environment variable as well (see the Tcl
   and Tk README files for information on this).

   You can type the following command in your shell:

  cd /home/src/Tix4.1.0/demos
  env TIX_LIBRARY=/home/src/Tix4.1.0/library ../unix/tk4.2/tixwish widget

   This will open up the Tix demo window. You can click on the "Run
   Sample Programs" tab and execute the sample programs:

  5. INSTALLING TIX

   If you are sufficiently convinced that Tix works properly, you can
   install the Tix binaries and scripts on your system. If you are
   paranoid, these is a small set of test scripts that tests the behavior
   of Tix under various configurations. You can do this by typing "make
   tests" inside the build-subdirectories, e.g.:

  cd /home/src/Tix4.1.0/unix/tk4.2
  make tests

   Hopefully it will report "0 error(s) found".

   Type "make install" to install Tix's binaries and script files in
   standard places:

  cd /home/src/Tix4.1.0/unix
  make install

   In the default configuration information will be installed in
   /usr/local so you'll need write permission on this directory. If
   you'd like to use a different installation directory, you can specify
   the "--exec-prefix" and "--prefix" options for the configure script in
   step 3 and then rebuild Tix.

  6. TROUBLE SHOOTING

   If make fails then you'll have to personalize the Makefile's for your
   site or possibly modify the distribution in other ways. First check
   the files docs/FAQ.html and docs/Porting.html to see if there are
   hints for compiling on your system. If you need to modify Makefile's,
   there are comments at the beginning of it that describe the things you
   might want to change and how to change them.

   If you have trouble compiling Tix, I'd suggest looking at the files
   docs/FAQ.html and docs/Porting.html. It contains information that
   people have sent me about changes they had to make to compile Tix in
   various environments.

   I make no guarantees that this information is accurate, complete, or
   up-to-date, but you may find it useful. If you get Tix running on a
   new configuration and had to make non-trivial changes to do it, I'd be
   happy to receive new information to add to docs/Porting.html. I'm also
   interested in hearing how to change the configuration setup so that
   Tix compiles on additional platforms "out of the box".
