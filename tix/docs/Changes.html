</ul><h3><a name=4.0.4+>Changes Since Tix 4.0.4</h3><ul>

<h4>5/5/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New tool unix-et-tk4.0/makescript.tcl. It
  includes the Tix script library into a ET application in the correct
  order. If A.tcl depends on B.tcl, then B.tcl is loaded first.<p>

<h4>5/6/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> Now the -default option of the Tix mega widget
  classes are inherited from their superclasses.<p>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New option -expand for the panes in PanedWindow<p>

  <li><b>Bug Fixed:</b> ScrolledHList didn't calculate the size of the
  hlist subwidget correctly, resulting in scrollbars not appearing
  even if the hlist widget is not big enough to display all of its
  contents.<p>

<h4>5/8/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New method setsize for PanedWindow.<p>

<h4>5/10/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New widget tixMeter, can be used to display the
  progress of work.<p>

  <li><b>Bug Fixed:</b> HList multiple and extended selectMode now work
  with TixTree.<p>

<h4>5/11/96</h4>

  <li><b>Bug Fixed:</b> HList "see" method sometimes doesn't display the
  specified element correctly.<p>

  <li><b>New widgets:</b> New widgets CheckList, Grid, ScrolledGrid, TList
  and ScrolledTList added to the Tix 4.1 distribution.<p>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New option -postcmd for PopupMenu widget.<p>

</ul><h3><a name=4.1a3+>Changes Since Tix 4.1a3<ul></h3>

<h4>7/14/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> Supports ET+TK4.1. --enable-tk41_et flag for
  configure script.<p>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> Supports ITCL 2.1. --enable-itcl21 flag for
  configure script.<p>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> Default color schemes and fontset can be set
  when Tix is compiled: --with-fontset= and --with-scheme= flags for
  configure script.<p>

  <li><b>Incompatibility:</b> All the "::" qualifiers in Tix class methods
  have been replaced by ":", so that the Tix classes can be loaded
  into Itcl without patching Itcl. If you have written your own Tix
  classes, you need to modify the source files to use the ":"
  qualifier instead. <p>

  The program tools/setcolon.sh helps you port your code from the "::"
  convention to the ":" convention. Execute the program without
  argument for usage syntax. It may modify your code in unexpected
  ways. Use with caution. <p>

<h4>7/15/96</h4>
  
  <li><b>New feature:</b> New function Tix_SetRcFileName() and new macros
  TCL_7_5_OR_LATER, TK_4_1_OR_LATER to provide better support for both
  Tcl7.4/Tk4.0 and Tcl7.5+/Tk4.1+. <p>

  <li><b>Bug Fixed:</b> <code>entrycget</code> method of OptionMenu didn't
  work as expected. <p>

<h4>7/17/96</h4>

  The demos-c subdirectory has been moved to demos/c-code. <p>

<h4>7/24/96</h4>

  <li><b>Bug Fixed:</b> tixMwm now deletes information about a toplevel
  when the toplevel is destroyed.<p>

<h4>8/22/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New command "tixConsoleInit" available with Tcl
  7.5/Tk 4.1. Create console window that runs in a separate
  interpreter. <p>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> Now Tix works under multiple interpreters. <p>

<h4>8/23/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> Now ListNoteBook uses a PanedWindow to manage
  the HList and the pages.<p>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New option -dynamicgeometry for PanedWindow.<p>

<h4>8/24/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New command "tixStrEq" compares the equality of
  two strings.<p>

<h4>9/12/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> Tix provides emulation for strcasecmp() for
  platforms that do not support this function.<p>

<h4>9/14/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New widget command <code>selection get</code>
  for HList. This is just an alias for <code>info
  selection</code>. It's added so that the API is similar to the TK
  API.<p>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New widget command <code>info bbox</code>
  for HList. Used mainly in regression tests. <p>

<h4>9/17/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> Orientation of the <b>pane</b> subwidget in
  <li><b>TixListNoteBook</b> now configureable via the <b>-options</b>
  switch during creation. <p>

<h4>9/22/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> Now the default fontset and color scheme are
  configurable in the setup.tcl program as well as in the configure
  script. <p>

</ul><h3><a name=4.1b1+>Changes Since Tix 4.1b1<ul></h3>

<h4>10/13/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> Now XPM image works on Windows. <p>

<h4>10/18/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New options -editablecmd and -editcmd for the
  Grid widget to support editing of the entries. <p>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New options -editablecmd and -editcmd for the
  Grid widget to support editing of the entries. <p>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New widget <b>TixFloatEntry</b> to support
  editing of DItems. <p>

<h4>10/27/96</h4>

  <li><b>Feature Change:</b> The following changes are made to the
  configuration and installation of Tix:
  <ul>

    <li> <b>Naming convention of binaries</b>: The binaries for the
	 Tk 4.0 target are called tixwish and libtix.a. For Tk 4.1 and
	 later, the executable is be called tixwish[Tix version].[Tk version]
	 and the library is called libtix[Tix version].[Tk
	 version].[lib extension]. For example, tixwish4.1.4.1 and
	 libtix4.1.4.2.so. On platforms that do not allow the dot
	 character in the names of shared libraries, the dot character
	 will be omitted. E.g., libtix4142.so.

    <li> <b>Shared vs static linking</b>: The static binary will be
	 created only if the -enable-[tkversion]-shared flag is
	 disabled. If you want to create both shared and static
	 binaries, configure and compile Tix twice.

    <li> ET support is replaced by SAM (stand-alone module)
	 support.

    <li> The following options are removed from configure:
	 <ul>
	   <li> -enable-tk40_et
	   <li> -enable-tk41_et
	   <li> -enable-tk41_shared
	 </ul>	 

    <li> The new options are added to configure:
	 <ul>
	   <li> -enable-tk40-sam
	   <li> -enable-tk41-sam
	   <li> -enable-tk42-sam
	   <li> -enable-tk41-shared
	   <li> -enable-tk42-shared
	 </ul>	 
  </ul>


<h4>11/1/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> XPM code has been rewritten. The code is now cleanly
  separated into three modules: generic, windows specific and Unix specific.
  <p>

  
<h4>11/17/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> Tix classes can be defined before their
  superclasses are defined. However, a class <b>cannot</b> be
  instantiated before all of its superclasses are defined. This
  feature makes it possible to load the Tix scripts into the SAM in
  any order, without having to worry about loading the superclasses
  before the subclasses. <p>
  
  <li><b>New feature:</b> Tix is initialized by calling the command
  <li><b>__tixInit</b>, not by sourcing <b>Init.tcl</b>. <p>
  
<h4>11/29/96</h4>

  <li><b>Bug Fixed:</b> tixTmpLine now correctly works on multiple X
  displays. <p>

<h4>11/30/96</h4>

  <li><b>Feature Change</b>: DisplayStyle now uses a hash table to store
  the items associated with it (previously a link list was used). This
  speeds up the delete operations when a lot (1000 or more) of items
  are associated with the same style. <b>Possible Incompatibility:</b>
  widgets that use DItems must be recompiled. <p>

  <li><b>Bug Fixed:</b> Tix no longer tempers with the way Tk handles
  errors, unless the environment variable TIX_DEBUG_INTERACTIVE is
  set. If this variable is set, all error messages will be printed to
  the standard output. This may be convenient for debugging
  purposes. Use this feature with discretion, and during program
  development only. <p>

</ul><h3><a name=4.1b1+>Changes Since Tix 4.1b2<ul></h3>
       
<h4>12/2/96</h4>

  <li><b>Bug Fixed:</b>Dotted anchor lines (HList, TList, Grid) and
  rubber-band lines (PanedWindow, ResizeHandle) are implemented on Windows.<p>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> Tcl 7.6 support is complete for the Windows
  platform. makefile.vc and makefile.bc have been modified such that
  the Tcl version can be chosen at compile time by, e.g., "<b>make
  TCL_VER=7.5 -f makefile.bc</b>". <p>
  
<h4>12/2/96</h4>
  
  <li><b>Bug Fixed:</b> Display items are correctly clipped. E.g., if a
  text item is wider than the width of a column in an HList, the item
  will be clipped.<p>

<h4>12/20/96</h4>

  <li><b>New feature:</b> New sample file demos/samples/EditGrid.tcl that
  demonstrates the use of an editable grid widget. <p>

<h4>12/21/96</h4>
  
  <li><b>Bug Fixed:</b> Tix works with multiple interpreters under tk4.1
  and 4.2 (see test/general/minterp.tcl). However, minterp.tcl still
  core dumps under Itcl 2.1. It is not clear to me whether this is a
  problem of Tix or Itcl. <p>

  <li><b>Bug Fixed:</b> Now when an interpreter is deleted, all Tix class
  informations associated with this interpreter are freed. (No memory
  leak is recorded by purify when running Tix against the complete
  test suite.) <p>

<h4>1/17/96</h4>

  <li><b>Feature Change:</b> The old monolithic configure script is now
  split into one script per version of Tk/Itcl (tk 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3,
  8.0 and itcl 2.0, 2.1, 2.1). This makes the maintainence of the
  configure scripts easier. The eight configure scripts and theisr
  associated Makefile.in are generated by the programs
  tools/doconfig.tcl and tools/domakefile.tcl. <p>

  <li><b>Feature Change:</b> The Unix binary build directories have been
  moved from <b>unix-tk4.x</b> into <b>unix/tk4.x</b>. The test
  directory has been renamed into <b>tests</b>.<p>

<h4>2/14/96</h4>

  <li><b>Feature Change:</b> Tix can be loaded using the "package
  require" command. The "binary version" associated with Tix binaries
  has been changed from 4.1.${TK_VERSION} to 4.1.${TCL_VERSION} (or
  4.1.${TCL_VERSION}.1 for Itcl). See <a
  href="Pkg.txt">docs/Pkg.txt</a> for details.

</ul><h3><a name=4.1.0+>Changes Since Tix 4.1.0<ul></h3>

<h4>4/7/97</h4>

  <li>New global Tcl variable tix_release that indicates a "release"
  of Tix. This makes it possible to identify frequent patch release of
  Tix without modifying the tix_version and tix_patchLevel variables. <p>

  <li> The missing "info selection" command is added to TList. Thanks
  to David Sundstrom for the patch. <p>
       
  <li> New "index" command for TList. <p>
       
  <li> The Itcl-enabled tixwish is installed as tixwish4.1.x.x.1 on Unix --
       with a .1 suffix similar to the shared library. <p>
       
<i>New patch release 4.1.0.001 uploaded to
ftp.xpi.com/pub/Tix4.1.0.tar.gz </i> <p>

<h4>6/17/97</h4>

  <li> New "info size" command for TList. <p>
       
<h4>6/27/97</h4>

  <li> New "see" command for TList. <p>

  <li> SAM works with Tk 8.0 and Itcl 2.2. (Only tixsam?.so is
  supported, no satixwish support.) <p>
