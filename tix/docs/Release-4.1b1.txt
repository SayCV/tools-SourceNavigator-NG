  TIX 4.1B1

   Released on September 30, 1996

Subject: [Announce] Tix version 4.1b1 is available

   I am pleased to announce the availability of Tix version 4.1b1, the
   first beta release. This version of Tix supports the Unix and
   Microsoft Windows platforms.

   This version of Tix is released under licensing terms similar to those
   of Tcl/Tk. Please read the file license.terms carefully before
   proceeding.

  REQUIREMENT

    Unix Platforms

   Tix 4.1b1 works with the following combinations of Tcl/Tk/ITcl/ET:
     * Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0
     * Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 + ITcl 2.0
     * Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 + ET 1.5
     * Tcl 7.5 + Tk 4.1 (final release only)
     * Tcl 7.5 + Tk 4.1 + ITcl 2.1
     * Tcl 7.5 + Tk 4.1 + ET 1.6

    Windows Platforms

   Tix 4.1b1 requires the final release of Tcl 7.5 and Tk 4.1 (no alpha
   or beta versions). Many things currently does not work under Windows,
   including:
     * FileSelectDialog (ExFileSelectDialog does work, though)
     * XPM images

  GETTING THE TIX PACKAGE

   Tix 4.1b1 sources are available at
     * ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/Tix4.1b1.tar.gz: Unix source tar file.

       Tix4.1b1.tar.gz, but in Windows/DOS ZIP format.

   We'll also release binary distributions of Tix. They will be available
   in a few days for all Windows 32 bit platforms (Win32s, Win95, WinNT

  WHAT'S NEW SINCE TIX 4.1A3 (THE LAST RELEASE)

    7/14/96

   New feature: Supports ET+TK4.1. --enable-tk41_et flag for configure
   script.

   New feature: Supports ITCL 2.1. --enable-itcl21 flag for configure
   script.

   New feature: Default color schemes and fontset can be set when Tix is
   compiled: --with-fontset= and --with-scheme= flags for configure
   script.

   Incompatibility: All the "::" qualifiers in Tix class methods have
   been replaced by ":", so that the Tix classes can be loaded into Itcl
   without patching Itcl. If you have written your own Tix classes, you
   need to modify the source files to use the ":" qualifier instead.

   The program tools/setcolon.sh helps you port your code from the "::"
   convention to the ":" convention. Execute the program without argument
   for usage syntax. It may modify your code in unexpected ways. Use with
   caution.

    7/15/96

   New feature: New function Tix_SetRcFileName() and new macros
   TCL_7_5_OR_LATER, TK_4_1_OR_LATER to provide better support for both
   Tcl7.4/Tk4.0 and Tcl7.5+/Tk4.1+.

   Bug Fixed: entrycget method of OptionMenu didn't work as expected.

    7/17/96

   The demos-c subdirectory has been moved to demos/c-code.

    7/24/96

   Bug Fixed: tixMwm now deletes information about a toplevel when the
   toplevel is destroyed.

    8/22/96

   New feature: New command "tixConsoleInit" available with Tcl 7.5/Tk
   4.1. Create console window that runs in a separate interpreter.

   New feature: Now Tix works under multiple interpreters.

    8/23/96

   New feature: Now ListNoteBook uses a PanedWindow to manage the HList
   and the pages.

   New feature: New option -dynamicgeometry for PanedWindow.

    8/24/96

   that do not support this function.

    9/14/96

   New feature: New widget command selection get for HList. This is just
   an alias for info selection. It's added so that the API is similar to
   the TK API.

   regression tests.

    9/17/96

   New feature: Orientation of the pane subwidget in TixListNoteBook now
