  TIX 4.1B2

   Released on December 28, 1996

Subject: [Announce] Tix version 4.1b2 is available

   I am pleased to announce the availability of Tix version 4.1b2, the
   first beta release. This version of Tix supports the Unix and
   Microsoft Windows platforms.

   The Tix library has by far the greatest collection of widgets for
   programming with Tcl/Tk. Highlights include: Hierarchical Listbox,
   Directory List/Tree View, SpreadSheet, Tabular Listbox, ComboBox,
   Motif style FileSelectBox, MS Windows style FileSelectBox,
   PanedWindow, NoteBook, Spin Control widget .... and many more. With
   these new widgets, your Tcl/Tk applications will look great and
   interact with your users in intuitive ways.

   For more info about Tix, visit the Tix home page at
   http://www.xpi.com/tix/ .

   This version of Tix is released under licensing terms similar to those
   of Tcl/Tk. Please read the file license.terms carefully before
   proceeding.

  WHAT'S NEW SINCE TIX 4.1A3 (THE LAST RELEASE)

    10/13/96

   New feature: Now XPM image works on Windows.

    10/18/96

   New feature: New options -editnotifycmd and -editdonecmd for the Grid
   widget to support editing of the entries.

   New feature: New widget TixFloatEntry to support editing of DItems.

    10/27/96

   Feature Change: The following changes are made to the configuration
   and installation of Tix:
     * Naming convention of binaries: The binaries for the Tk 4.0 target
       are called tixwish and libtix.a. For Tk 4.1 and later, the
       executable is be called tixwish[Tix version].[Tk version] and the
       library is called libtix[Tix version].[Tk version].[lib
       extension]. For example, tixwish4.1.4.1 and libtix4.1.4.2.so. On
       platforms that do not allow the dot character in the names of
       shared libraries, the dot character will be omitted. E.g.,
       libtix4142.so.
     * Shared vs static linking: The static binary will be created only
       if the -enable-[tkversion]-shared flag is disabled. If you want to
       create both shared and static binaries, configure and compile Tix
       twice.
     * ET support is replaced by SAM (stand-alone module) support.
     * The following options are removed from configure:
          + -enable-tk40_et
          + -enable-tk41_et
          + -enable-tk41_shared
     * The new options are added to configure:
          + -enable-tk40-sam
          + -enable-tk41-sam
          + -enable-tk42-sam
          + -enable-tk41-shared
          + -enable-tk42-shared

    11/1/96

   New feature: XPM code has been rewritten. The code is now cleanly
   separated into three modules: generic, windows specific and Unix
   specific.

    11/17/96

   New feature: Tix classes can be defined before their superclasses are
   defined. However, a class cannot be instantiated before all of its
   superclasses are defined. This feature makes it possible to load the
   Tix scripts into the SAM in any order, without having to worry about
   loading the superclasses before the subclasses.

   New feature: Tix is initialized by calling the command __tixInit, not
   by sourcing Init.tcl.

    11/29/96

   Bug Fixed: tixTmpLine now correctly works on multiple X displays.

    11/30/96

   Feature Change: DisplayStyle now uses a hash table to store the items
   associated with it (previously a link list was used). This speeds up
   the delete operations when a lot (1000 or more) of items are
   associated with the same style. Possible Incompatibility: widgets that
   use DItems must be recompiled.

   Bug Fixed: Tix no longer tempers with the way Tk handles errors,
   unless the environment variable TIX_DEBUG_INTERACTIVE is set. If this
   variable is set, all error messages will be printed to the standard
   output. This may be convenient for debugging purposes. Use this
   feature with discretion, and during program development only.

    12/2/96

   Bug Fixed:Dotted anchor lines (HList, TList, Grid) and rubber-band
   lines (PanedWindow, ResizeHandle) are implemented on Windows.

   New feature: Tcl 7.6 support is complete for the Windows platform.
   makefile.vc and makefile.bc have been modified such that the Tcl
   version can be chosen at compile time by, e.g., "make TCL_VER=7.5 -f
   makefile.bc".

    12/2/96

   Bug Fixed: Display items are correctly clipped. E.g., if a text item
   is wider than the width of a column in an HList, the item will be
   clipped.

    12/20/96

   New feature: New sample file demos/samples/EditGrid.tcl that
   demonstrates the use of an editable grid widget.

    12/21/96

   Bug Fixed: Tix works with multiple interpreters under tk4.1 and 4.2
   (see test/general/minterp.tcl). However, minterp.tcl still core dumps
   under Itcl 2.1. It is not clear to me whether this is a problem of Tix
   or Itcl.

   Bug Fixed: Now when an interpreter is deleted, all Tix class
   informations associated with this interpreter are freed. (No memory
   leak is recorded by purify when running Tix against the complete test
   suite.)
