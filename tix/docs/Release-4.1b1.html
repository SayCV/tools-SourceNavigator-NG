Subject: [Announce] Tix version 4.1b1 is available

</pre>

   I am pleased to announce the availability of Tix version 4.1b1, the
   first beta release. This version of Tix supports the Unix and
   Microsoft Windows platforms. <p>

   This version of Tix is released under licensing terms similar to
   those of Tcl/Tk. Please read the file license.terms carefully
   before proceeding. <p>

<h3>Requirement</h3>

<h4>Unix Platforms</h4>
   
   Tix 4.1b1 works with the following combinations of Tcl/Tk/ITcl/ET:
   <ul>
     <li> Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 
     <li> Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 + ITcl 2.0
     <li> Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 + ET 1.5
     <li> Tcl 7.5 + Tk 4.1 (final release only)
     <li> Tcl 7.5 + Tk 4.1 + ITcl 2.1
     <li> Tcl 7.5 + Tk 4.1 + ET 1.6
   </ul>

<h4>Windows Platforms</h4>

   Tix 4.1b1 requires the final release of Tcl 7.5 and Tk 4.1 (no
   alpha or beta versions). Many things currently does not work under
   Windows, including:
   <ul>
     <li> FileSelectDialog (ExFileSelectDialog does work, though)

   </ul>

<h3>What's New Since Tix 4.1a3 (the last release)</h3>

<h4>7/14/96</h4>

  <b>New feature:</b> Supports ET+TK4.1. --enable-tk41_et flag for
  configure script.<p>

  <b>New feature:</b> Supports ITCL 2.1. --enable-itcl21 flag for
  configure script.<p>

  <b>New feature:</b> Default color schemes and fontset can be set
  when Tix is compiled: --with-fontset= and --with-scheme= flags for
  configure script.<p>

  <b>Incompatibility:</b> All the "::" qualifiers in Tix class methods
  have been replaced by ":", so that the Tix classes can be loaded
  into Itcl without patching Itcl. If you have written your own Tix
  classes, you need to modify the source files to use the ":"
  qualifier instead. <p>

  The program tools/setcolon.sh helps you port your code from the "::"
  convention to the ":" convention. Execute the program without
  argument for usage syntax. It may modify your code in unexpected
  ways. Use with caution. <p>

<h4>7/15/96</h4>
  
  <b>New feature:</b> New function Tix_SetRcFileName() and new macros
  TCL_7_5_OR_LATER, TK_4_1_OR_LATER to provide better support for both
  Tcl7.4/Tk4.0 and Tcl7.5+/Tk4.1+. <p>

  <b>Bug Fixed:</b> <code>entrycget</code> method of OptionMenu didn't
  work as expected. <p>

  when the toplevel is destroyed.<p>

<h4>8/22/96</h4>

  for HList. This is just an alias for <code>info
  selection</code>. It's added so that the API is similar to the TK
  API.<p>

  for HList. Used mainly in regression tests. <p>
