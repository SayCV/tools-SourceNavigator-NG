  This version of Tix supports both Unix and Windows platforms. We
  provide binary distribution for Windows and popular Unix platforms
  (SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.x and Linux) for hassle-free
  installation. <p>

  If you use other platforms, you have to download the Tix source and
  build it yourself. The following documents guide you through the
  process of building Tix step by step. There are automatic
  configuration tools to aid you in building Tix. If you have built
  Tcl/Tk or Tcl extensions before, building Tix should be straight
  forward. <p>
