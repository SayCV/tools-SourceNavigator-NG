The Ant build.xml file in this directory compiles all db Java sources (except
examples), runs the test suite using Clover to instrument the sources, and then
generates the Clover coverage reports.

You must place clover.jar in your Ant lib directory as well as placing
clover.jar and velocity.jar in this directory.  (Using a classpathref in the
Ant javac task doesn't seem to work.)

$ cp <YOUR-CLOVER-INSTALL>/clover.jar .
$ cp <YOUR-CLOVER-INSTALL>/velocity.jar .
$ cp clover.jar <YOUR-ANT-DIRECTORY>/lib
$ ant all

'ant all' will delete all output files, compile and run the tests, and then
generate the reports.

'ant' will compile sources that need compiling and run the tests to collect
coverage information.

'ant report' will generate the reports against the current coverage database.

The build.xml file works when run from db/test/scr024/coverage but it should
also work when run from a build directory copied by the TCL test harness, e.g.,
db/build_unix/TESTDIR/coverage.
